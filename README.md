# Drum_Kit
Website built on HTML,CSS &amp; JS to play different sounds via keyboard keys and mouse clicks.

It has 2 folders and 3 files.

1. images - contains all the images that served as the background images for the buttons.

2. sounds - all the sounds are stored in this file.

3. index.html - Markup structure for the application.

4. styles.css - styling of the website.

5. index.js - it contains all the logic behind the website.

> This application reacts on mouse clicks as well as keyboard keys when they are pressed(reacts under both the cases i.e lowercase and uppercase).

When the user clicks on any button or press corresponding keyboard keys, it will first get highlighted acknowledging to the user that it has been clicked and then the corresponding sound will be produced. Its like having a mini version of piano app, where you click or tap on the keys and the respective sounds get generated.
